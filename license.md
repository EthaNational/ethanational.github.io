# ScriptJams License (CCL)

**Copyright © 2025 ScriptJams**
**All Rights Reserved.**

## 1. Introduction

This ScriptJams License (the “License” or “Agreement”) is a legally binding agreement between ScriptJams, its affiliates, successors, and assigns (hereinafter referred to as the “Licensor” or “ScriptJams”), and any natural person, legal entity, partnership, organization, or institution (hereinafter referred to as the “Licensee”). This Agreement governs the rights and responsibilities associated with the download, installation, integration, modification, use, or distribution of the ScriptJams codebase, libraries, scripts, tools, or any related components (collectively, the “Software”).

By installing, accessing, executing, compiling, modifying, or otherwise making any use of the Software, the Licensee expressly acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all terms and conditions contained within this License. If the Licensee does not agree to the terms, conditions, restrictions, and obligations set forth herein, then they must immediately discontinue use of the Software and permanently remove all copies in their possession or control.

The purpose of this Agreement is to establish clear legal boundaries regarding the permitted use of the Software, while simultaneously protecting ScriptJams’ intellectual property rights, development reputation, and authorship integrity.

---

## 2. Definitions

For the purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply. These definitions are intended to provide clarity and must be interpreted broadly in favor of the Licensor’s rights and intentions:

1. **“Software”** shall mean any and all source code, object code, scripts, binaries, libraries, algorithms, functions, build systems, and associated materials made available by ScriptJams under this License, including but not limited to derivative works, updates, patches, and extensions authored by ScriptJams.

2. **“Licensee”** shall mean any individual, developer, organization, company, or entity that downloads, installs, integrates, modifies, or uses the Software in any manner, whether for personal, educational, non-commercial, or commercial purposes.

3. **“Modification”** shall mean any change, addition, alteration, enhancement, extension, adaptation, or removal made to the Software, whether in source code or compiled form, including the creation of derivative works or adaptations.

4. **“Derivative Work”** shall mean any software, project, system, or component created by the Licensee that is based on, incorporates, or otherwise makes use of the Software, in whole or in part, whether modified or unmodified.

5. **“Redistribution”** shall mean the act of sharing, transmitting, licensing, sublicensing, publishing, or otherwise distributing the Software or any portion thereof to third parties, whether modified or unmodified, whether for free or for monetary gain.

6. **“Attribution”** shall mean proper acknowledgment of ScriptJams as the original author and creator of the Software, presented in a form that is reasonably visible and accessible to end users, including but not limited to credit notices within source code, documentation, user manuals, public repositories, or software interfaces.

7. **“Author Rights”** shall mean the perpetual, irrevocable, and continuing rights retained by ScriptJams over its authored contributions within the Software, as described in Section 7 of this Agreement.

8. **“Audit”** shall mean the formal right of ScriptJams to request inspection, review, or verification of Licensee’s compliance with this License, including examination of source repositories, compiled binaries, or associated project documentation.

These definitions are non-exhaustive and may be supplemented by additional context elsewhere in this License. Where ambiguity arises, the interpretation most favorable to ScriptJams’ ownership, rights, and protections shall prevail.

## 3. Grant of License

Subject to the Licensee’s full compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, ScriptJams hereby grants the Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Software as follows:

1. The Licensee may download, install, and use the Software for personal, educational, research, experimental, or commercial purposes, provided such use does not violate the restrictions set forth herein.

2. The Licensee may incorporate the Software into projects, whether internal or public-facing, commercial or non-commercial, without the requirement to attribute ScriptJams, so long as the Software is used in an unmodified state.

3. The Licensee may modify the Software, create derivative works, or adapt the Software for their own projects, **but only if proper Attribution is provided to ScriptJams** in accordance with Section 6.

4. All rights not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved by ScriptJams. The Licensee acknowledges that this Agreement does not transfer ownership of the Software or any intellectual property rights therein, but merely grants a limited right of use.

This grant of license may be revoked at ScriptJams’ sole discretion if the Licensee is found to be in violation of any terms or restrictions imposed herein.

---

## 4. Conditions of Use

The Licensee agrees to comply with the following conditions when making use of the Software:

1. The Licensee shall not use the Software for unlawful, fraudulent, harmful, or malicious purposes, including but not limited to the development of malware, spyware, ransomware, data harvesting systems, or systems intended to cause harm to individuals, organizations, or infrastructure.

2. The Licensee shall not misrepresent the origin, authorship, or ownership of the Software. If modifications are made, the Licensee must make it explicitly clear that such modifications are their own and that ScriptJams is the original author of the unmodified Software.

3. If the Licensee modifies or adapts the Software, they are required to provide visible Attribution to ScriptJams in accordance with Section 6. If no modifications are made, Attribution is optional and not required.

4. The Licensee shall not attempt to circumvent, obstruct, or interfere with ScriptJams’ exercise of its Author Rights as defined in Section 7 of this License.

## 5. Restrictions

In addition to the conditions of use, the Licensee is expressly prohibited from engaging in the following actions:

1. The Licensee may not redistribute, sublicense, or otherwise release the Software under their own name, brand, or organizational identity, whether in modified or unmodified form.

2. The Licensee may not re-license the Software under alternative open-source or proprietary licenses, including but not limited to GPL, MIT, Apache, BSD, or Creative Commons licenses, as such re-licensing may conflict with ScriptJams’ intellectual property rights.

3. The Licensee may not remove, obscure, alter, or falsify any copyright notices, license terms, or author statements contained in the Software when distributing a modified version.

4. The Licensee may not use the Software in any manner that infringes upon the intellectual property rights of ScriptJams or third parties.

5. The Licensee may not employ the Software in jurisdictions where its use would be prohibited by applicable law, export control regulations, or international trade restrictions.

---

## 6. Attribution (Conditional Obligation)

1. **Unmodified Use**: If the Licensee uses the Software in its original, unmodified state, no attribution to ScriptJams is required. Licensee may incorporate the Software freely into projects, including commercial projects, without any public acknowledgment, provided that the Software remains unaltered.

2. **Modified Use**: If the Licensee modifies, alters, or creates derivative works based on the Software, then clear Attribution to ScriptJams is required. Such Attribution must acknowledge ScriptJams as the original creator and author of the base Software.

3. **Forms of Attribution**: Attribution must be reasonably accessible to end users and may take one or more of the following forms:

   * Inclusion of copyright and license notices in the source code.
   * Reference to ScriptJams in project documentation, user guides, or help menus.
   * Visible acknowledgment within publicly accessible repositories (such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket project descriptions).
   * Placement of credit in “About” sections, credits screens, or footers of products incorporating the Software.

4. **Omission of Attribution** in modified works constitutes a material breach of this License and will result in immediate termination of rights.

---

## 7. Author Rights

ScriptJams retains perpetual and irrevocable rights to its authored contributions within the Software. These rights shall survive regardless of whether the Software is modified, integrated, or otherwise incorporated into Licensee projects.

1. ScriptJams reserves the right to issue requests for changes, corrections, or removals of any portion of the Software incorporated into Licensee projects.

2. ScriptJams further retains the unilateral right to directly make modifications, corrections, or removals to its authored contributions within Licensee projects, without requiring prior approval or agreement from the Licensee, provided such modifications pertain exclusively to portions originally authored by ScriptJams.

3. The Licensee agrees not to obstruct, interfere with, or otherwise prevent ScriptJams from exercising its Author Rights. The Licensee further agrees to act in good faith by accommodating such actions and, where required, by implementing requested changes within a commercially reasonable timeframe, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days.

4. These Author Rights are intended to protect ScriptJams’ authorship integrity, ensure technical accuracy, and safeguard the reputation of ScriptJams and its contributors.

---

## 8. Audit and Compliance

In order to ensure adherence to the terms of this License, ScriptJams reserves the right to conduct compliance audits of Licensee projects in which the Software is incorporated.

1. ScriptJams may issue a written request for audit, specifying the scope of review and the timeframe within which the Licensee must provide access.

2. The Licensee agrees to cooperate fully by granting ScriptJams reasonable access to relevant project repositories, build environments, compiled binaries, or other necessary materials for the purpose of verifying compliance.

3. Audits shall be conducted during normal business hours and with reasonable notice, except in cases of suspected intentional violation, in which ScriptJams may conduct audits with minimal or no prior notice.

4. Should an audit reveal a material breach of this License, the Licensee shall bear the costs associated with the audit, in addition to any other remedies available to ScriptJams.

5. Failure to comply with an audit request shall itself be deemed a violation of this License.

---

## 9. Termination

This Agreement, and the rights granted herein, shall remain in full force and effect unless and until terminated as provided below.

1. **Termination by ScriptJams.** ScriptJams reserves the sole and exclusive right to terminate this License immediately and without prior notice if the Licensee engages in conduct that constitutes a material breach of any of the terms herein. Material breach shall include, but is not limited to: (i) redistribution of the Software in violation of Section 5, (ii) failure to provide Attribution when modifications are made as required by Section 6, (iii) obstruction or interference with ScriptJams’ exercise of Author Rights under Section 7, or (iv) refusal to comply with audit requests pursuant to Section 8.

2. **Termination by Licensee.** The Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time by permanently ceasing use of the Software, removing all copies of the Software from their systems, and destroying all associated documentation. Such termination shall not relieve the Licensee of any obligations accrued prior to termination, including obligations to provide Attribution where required.

3. **Effect of Termination.** Upon termination of this License, the Licensee shall immediately and permanently discontinue use of the Software and all derivative works incorporating the Software. Any continued use, retention, or distribution of the Software following termination shall constitute willful infringement of ScriptJams’ intellectual property rights.

4. **Survival of Provisions.** Notwithstanding termination, the following provisions shall survive in perpetuity: Section 2 (Definitions), Section 5 (Restrictions), Section 6 (Attribution), Section 7 (Author Rights), Section 8 (Audit and Compliance), Section 10 (Limitation of Liability), Section 11 (Indemnification), and Section 14 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction).

---

## 10. Enforcement and Remedies

1. **Right to Injunctive Relief.** The Licensee acknowledges and agrees that any violation of this License would cause ScriptJams irreparable harm for which monetary damages alone would be inadequate. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, ScriptJams shall be entitled to seek and obtain injunctive relief to prevent or restrain any actual or threatened violation of this License without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting bond.

2. **Right to Damages.** ScriptJams shall be entitled to recover from the Licensee any and all damages incurred as a result of Licensee’s breach, including direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, and special damages, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs of enforcement, and audit costs as described in Section 8.

3. **Termination for Non-Compliance.** ScriptJams may immediately terminate this License in the event of a breach, in accordance with Section 9. Such termination shall not limit ScriptJams’ entitlement to damages or equitable relief.

4. **Cumulative Remedies.** All rights and remedies available to ScriptJams under this License shall be cumulative and non-exclusive. The exercise of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy available under this License, at law, or in equity.

5. **Notice of Breach.** ScriptJams may, at its discretion, issue a written notice of breach to the Licensee prior to initiating legal action. Such notice shall specify the nature of the violation and provide a period not exceeding thirty (30) days within which the Licensee must cure the violation. Failure to cure within the specified period shall entitle ScriptJams to pursue all available remedies without further notice.

---

## 11. Warranty Disclaimer

1. **No Warranty.** THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. SCRIPTJAMS MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR COMPATIBLE WITH ANY PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT OR SYSTEM CONFIGURATION.

2. **No Guarantee of Performance.** The Licensee acknowledges that ScriptJams does not guarantee the performance, functionality, or results derived from the use of the Software. Any reliance placed upon the Software is strictly at the Licensee’s own risk.

3. **No Maintenance Obligation.** ScriptJams has no obligation to provide maintenance, support, updates, patches, bug fixes, or enhancements to the Licensee. Any such updates or modifications, if provided, shall be delivered solely at ScriptJams’ discretion and subject to this License.

---

## 12. Limitation of Liability

1. **Exclusion of Damages.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall ScriptJams, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, contractors, or agents be liable to the Licensee or to any third party for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with this License or the use of the Software, even if ScriptJams has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

2. **Limitation on Direct Damages.** ScriptJams’ total cumulative liability to the Licensee for any claim arising out of or relating to this License or the Software shall not exceed the greater of: (i) one hundred U.S. dollars (USD \$100), or (ii) the total fees actually paid by the Licensee to ScriptJams in exchange for the Software, if any.

3. **Jurisdictional Limitations.** Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages; therefore, certain limitations above may not apply. In such jurisdictions, ScriptJams’ liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

---

## 13. Indemnification

1. **Licensee’s Duty to Indemnify.** The Licensee shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ScriptJams, its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, contractors, licensors, successors, and assigns (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, suits, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs) arising out of or in connection with:

   a. The Licensee’s use, misuse, or modification of the Software;
   b. The Licensee’s failure to comply with any term, covenant, or condition of this License;
   c. Any claim by a third party that the Licensee’s use of the Software infringes or misappropriates intellectual property rights, except to the extent such claim arises solely from unmodified Software as originally distributed by ScriptJams;
   d. Any claim, dispute, or liability resulting from products, services, or applications developed by the Licensee using the Software, including but not limited to end-user claims, consumer protection claims, or governmental regulatory enforcement actions.

2. **Procedure for Indemnification.** In the event that any claim subject to indemnification arises:
   a. ScriptJams shall provide the Licensee with prompt written notice of the claim;
   b. The Licensee shall assume full control of the defense and settlement of the claim, provided that no settlement shall impose any financial or injunctive obligation upon ScriptJams without its prior written consent;
   c. ScriptJams shall cooperate reasonably with the Licensee at the Licensee’s expense.

3. **Failure to Defend.** If the Licensee fails to assume control of the defense of such claim within a reasonable time, ScriptJams may, at its option, assume its own defense and seek reimbursement of all associated costs from the Licensee.

---

## 14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

1. **Choice of Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, without regard to conflict of law principles or provisions that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

2. **Exclusive Jurisdiction.** The Licensee agrees that any legal action, proceeding, or dispute arising under or relating to this License shall be brought exclusively before the state and federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware. The Licensee hereby irrevocably consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and waives any objections based on inconvenient forum, lack of jurisdiction, or improper venue.

3. **Alternative Dispute Resolution.** Prior to commencing litigation, the Parties shall make good faith efforts to resolve disputes through direct negotiation. If such negotiation fails, the Parties agree to submit the dispute to mediation administered by a neutral third party mutually selected. If mediation is unsuccessful after sixty (60) days, either Party may proceed with formal litigation.

4. **Waiver of Jury Trial.** The Licensee knowingly, voluntarily, and irrevocably waives any right to a trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

5. **International Users.** If the Licensee is domiciled outside the United States, the Licensee acknowledges that use of the Software subjects them to U.S. jurisdiction and agrees not to contest the enforcement of judgments rendered by courts in Delaware in their own jurisdiction.

---

## 15. Severability

1. **Severability Clause.** If any provision of this License is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to reflect the original intent of the Parties, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

2. **Reformation of Invalid Provisions.** In the event that a provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that a substitute provision shall be deemed automatically inserted into this Agreement, which comes closest to expressing the original intent of the Parties while remaining valid and enforceable.

3. **No Waiver of Entire Agreement.** The invalidity of a single provision shall not invalidate this License in its entirety. The Parties expressly agree that their intention is for this Agreement to remain binding even if portions are deemed unenforceable.

---

## 16. Entire Agreement and Amendments

1. **Entire Agreement.** This License constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter herein and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, representations, proposals, understandings, or agreements, whether oral, written, or electronic, relating to the Software. The Parties expressly disclaim reliance upon any prior statements or representations not incorporated into this License.

2. **No Oral Modifications.** No oral statements, discussions, or communications made by ScriptJams, its representatives, or any third party shall modify, alter, or expand the terms of this License. Any purported oral modification shall be null and void.

3. **Amendments in Writing.** This License may only be amended, modified, or supplemented by a written instrument executed by an authorized representative of ScriptJams. The Licensee shall not be entitled to propose amendments or demand modifications except through a formal request submitted in writing, which ScriptJams may accept, reject, or ignore at its sole discretion.

4. **Electronic Amendments.** ScriptJams reserves the right to amend this License electronically by publishing a revised version of the License on its official repository, website, or distribution channel. Continued use of the Software following the effective date of such amendments shall constitute acceptance of the revised terms.

5. **Priority of Agreement.** In the event of any conflict between the terms of this License and any other agreement, policy, or document presented to the Licensee, the terms of this License shall prevail unless expressly superseded in a later written amendment executed by ScriptJams.

---

## 17. Assignment and Transfer

1. **Restrictions on Assignment by Licensee.** The Licensee may not assign, delegate, sublicense, sell, transfer, or otherwise convey any rights or obligations under this License without the prior written consent of ScriptJams. Any attempted assignment in violation of this provision shall be null and void ab initio and constitute a material breach of this License.

2. **Permitted Successors.** Subject to Section 17(1), this License shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their permitted successors and assigns.

3. **Assignment by ScriptJams.** ScriptJams may freely assign, transfer, delegate, or otherwise convey its rights and obligations under this License in whole or in part, without notice to or consent of the Licensee, to any successor entity, acquirer, affiliate, or third party designated by ScriptJams.

4. **Effect of Corporate Transactions.** In the event of a merger, acquisition, corporate restructuring, or sale of substantially all assets of the Licensee, this License shall not automatically transfer to the resulting entity without the express written consent of ScriptJams. If such consent is withheld, continued use of the Software shall be deemed unauthorized, and the Licensee shall immediately cease all use of the Software.

5. **Survival of Obligations.** Any attempted transfer or assignment by the Licensee without proper authorization shall not relieve the Licensee of its obligations under this License, including indemnification, attribution (when required), and compliance obligations.

---

## 18. Force Majeure

1. **Definition of Force Majeure.** Neither Party shall be liable or responsible for any failure or delay in performance, in whole or in part, arising out of or caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, fire, flood, earthquake, epidemic, pandemic, war, terrorism, civil unrest, government restrictions, labor disputes, supply chain disruptions, denial-of-service attacks, telecommunications failures, or interruptions of power or Internet services (each a “Force Majeure Event”).

2. **Effect of Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event prevents either Party from fulfilling its obligations under this License, such obligations shall be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure Event, provided that the affected Party gives prompt written notice to the other Party describing the nature of the event and its expected duration.

3. **Duty to Mitigate.** The Party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the event, resume performance as soon as practicable, and keep the other Party informed of progress.

4. **Termination Due to Prolonged Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than ninety (90) consecutive days, ScriptJams may, at its sole discretion, terminate this License immediately by providing written notice to the Licensee.

---

## 19. Survival of Obligations

1. **General Survival.** Notwithstanding the termination or expiration of this License for any reason, the obligations set forth herein which, by their nature, are intended to survive termination shall remain in full force and effect.

2. **Specific Clauses Surviving.** The following provisions, without limitation, shall survive termination:

   * Section 2 (Definitions)
   * Section 5 (Restrictions on Use and Redistribution)

3. **Rationale for Survival.** The survival of these provisions is necessary to preserve ScriptJams’ rights, remedies, and protections beyond the term of active use of the Software, ensuring that misuse or infringement occurring after termination remains actionable.

---

## 20. Miscellaneous Provisions

1. **Headings.** The section and subsection headings contained in this License are for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning, construction, or interpretation of this Agreement.

2. **Counterparts.** This License may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

3. **Electronic Execution.** The Parties agree that electronic acceptance, electronic signatures, or digital acknowledgments (such as a “clickwrap” or “shrinkwrap” agreement) shall be deemed valid and binding execution of this License.

4. **Waiver.** The failure of ScriptJams to enforce any provision of this License shall not be deemed a waiver of ScriptJams’ right to enforce such provision or any other provision at any time thereafter.

5. **No Partnership.** Nothing in this License shall be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency relationship between the Licensee and ScriptJams. The Licensee has no authority to bind ScriptJams in any manner whatsoever.

# **Appendix A: Attribution Examples**

*(Illustrative Guidance for Compliance with Section 6 – Attribution Requirements in Cases of Modification)*

### A.1 Purpose of this Appendix

This Appendix is provided as a non-binding but strongly encouraged interpretative guide to assist Licensees in understanding the scope, application, and expectations of the attribution obligations set forth in Section 6 of this License. While the terms of Section 6 remain legally binding, this Appendix offers practical illustrations, explanatory notes, and model attribution language that Licensees may use or adapt when complying with the License. The examples set forth herein are intended to remove ambiguity, promote uniform compliance, and reduce the likelihood of inadvertent violations of the License due to misunderstanding or oversight.

---

### A.2 General Principles of Attribution

1. Attribution is required **only in cases where the Licensee modifies, alters, extends, or otherwise changes the Software**. If the Licensee merely uses the Software without making modifications, no attribution is strictly required under this License, though voluntary acknowledgment remains encouraged.
2. Attribution must be **clear, legible, and reasonably accessible** to users of the Licensee’s project in which the modified Software is incorporated.
3. Attribution should identify:

   * (a) the original source of the Software (i.e., ScriptJams),
   * (b) the fact that the Software was modified,
   * (c) the Licensee responsible for the modifications.
4. Attribution need not disclose proprietary details of the Licensee’s project but must truthfully acknowledge ScriptJams’ original authorship when derivative changes are presented as part of a larger work.

---

### A.3 Acceptable Attribution Formats

**Example A.3.1 – In Documentation**
If a Licensee modifies the Software and distributes it as part of a larger application, attribution may appear in the project’s README, user manual, or documentation as follows:

> “This project incorporates modified portions of ScriptJams Software, originally authored by ScriptJams (Copyright © 2025). Modifications to the original code were made by \[Licensee’s Name or Organization].”

**Example A.3.2 – In Application Interfaces**
If the Software is modified and distributed as part of a graphical application, attribution may be provided in an “About” dialog, credits screen, or settings menu:

> “Portions of this application are based on modified ScriptJams Software. Original code by ScriptJams. Modified and adapted by \[Licensee].”

**Example A.3.3 – In Source Code Headers**
If the Licensee modifies specific files, attribution may appear at the top of the relevant source code file in a comment block:

```
// This file includes modifications to ScriptJams Software (© 2025 ScriptJams).  
// Original portions by ScriptJams. Modifications by [Licensee].  
```

---

### A.4 Insufficient or Non-Compliant Attribution

The following examples **do not satisfy** the attribution requirement:

1. **Silent Modification:** Making changes to the Software and distributing it without any mention of ScriptJams.
2. **Generic Reference:** Statements such as “based on open-source code” without specifically naming ScriptJams.
3. **False Ownership:** Claiming authorship of ScriptJams’ original unmodified code by omitting ScriptJams entirely.
4. **Obscured Attribution:** Burying attribution in a location that is unlikely to be seen by users (e.g., in a deeply nested file without documentation, or in a private internal document not accessible to end-users).

---

### A.5 Case Studies

**Case Study 1 – Compliant Attribution**
A software company modifies the ScriptJams Software to add new functionality and integrates it into its proprietary web platform. The company provides the following notice in its documentation:

> “This platform contains modified ScriptJams Software, Copyright © 2025 ScriptJams. Original code by ScriptJams. Additional modifications and integrations by Acme Web Technologies, LLC.”
> This notice is compliant, as it acknowledges ScriptJams, specifies that modifications were made, and identifies the modifying party.

**Case Study 2 – Non-Compliant Attribution**
A developer modifies the ScriptJams Software, removes identifying copyright notices, and redistributes the modified version solely under their own name as “JohnDoe Framework.” This action violates Section 6 because it conceals ScriptJams’ contribution and fails to provide any form of attribution for the modifications.

**Case Study 3 – Optional Voluntary Attribution**
A developer uses the unmodified ScriptJams Software as part of an internal tool but makes no changes. Under this License, no attribution is required. However, the developer voluntarily acknowledges ScriptJams in their README, stating:

> “This tool incorporates ScriptJams Software (unmodified).”
> While optional, such voluntary attribution is encouraged as a professional courtesy.

---

### A.6 Practical Checklist for Licensees

To ensure compliance with attribution obligations when making modifications, the Licensee should ask:

1. Did I change, alter, or modify the Software in any way?
2. If yes, have I clearly acknowledged ScriptJams as the original author?
3. Have I specified that modifications were made and who made them?
4. Is the attribution visible, accessible, and understandable to end-users or project maintainers?
5. Does the attribution avoid exaggerating or understating ScriptJams’ contribution?

If the Licensee can answer “yes” to all of the above, the attribution is most likely compliant.

# **Appendix B: Examples of Violations and Remedies**

*(Illustrative Guidance for Compliance with Sections 5, 7, 8, and 10 – Restrictions, Author Rights, Audit, and Enforcement)*

---

### B.1 Purpose of this Appendix

The purpose of this Appendix is to furnish Licensees with tangible, real-world style examples of behaviors, actions, or omissions that may constitute violations of the License, together with the remedies, enforcement measures, and potential legal consequences that may follow. While this Appendix does not modify or replace the binding obligations of the License, it serves as interpretive guidance to clarify how ScriptJams may apply enforcement discretion in different scenarios.

By illustrating both compliant and non-compliant behavior, this Appendix ensures that Licensees cannot claim ignorance or confusion as a defense against violations. Each case study herein is illustrative only; actual enforcement actions may vary depending on the specific facts, the severity of the violation, and the level of cooperation exhibited by the Licensee during the resolution process.

---

### B.2 Categories of Violations

Violations of this License generally fall into the following categories:

1. **Unauthorized Redistribution** – distributing or publishing the Software under the Licensee’s own name or brand without proper authorization.
2. **Failure to Attribute When Required** – failing to provide attribution when modifications are made to the Software.
3. **Misrepresentation of Origin** – claiming ownership or authorship of unmodified ScriptJams code.
4. **Obstruction of Author Rights** – preventing or refusing to allow ScriptJams to exercise its rights to request modifications, corrections, or removals under Section 7.
5. **Non-Compliance with Audit** – refusing to comply with ScriptJams’ audit requests as provided in Section 8.
6. **Bad-Faith Use** – using the Software in ways intended to circumvent the License or harm ScriptJams’ reputation.

### B.3 Examples of Violations

**Example B.3.1 – Unauthorized Redistribution under a Different Brand**
A developer downloads the ScriptJams Software, makes only minor cosmetic changes, and re-releases it publicly under a new brand called “LightningCode Framework.” The developer removes references to ScriptJams entirely and promotes the framework as their own innovation.

* **Violation:** This constitutes both “Unauthorized Redistribution” and “Misrepresentation of Origin.”
* **Consequences:** Immediate termination of the License, issuance of cease-and-desist orders, potential legal action for copyright infringement, and recovery of damages.

**Example B.3.2 – Failure to Attribute After Modifications**
A company integrates the ScriptJams Software into its commercial web tool and makes several changes to the underlying code to adapt it to their system. The company distributes the modified version but does not provide attribution to ScriptJams, despite Section 6 requiring such attribution when modifications are made.

* **Violation:** Failure to Attribute When Required.
* **Consequences:** Formal notice of breach, requirement to issue corrective attribution in all future releases, possible damages if the omission caused reputational or financial harm to ScriptJams.

**Example B.3.3 – Refusal of Audit Request**
ScriptJams issues an audit request to verify whether a Licensee is properly attributing modifications in a distributed software package. The Licensee refuses to provide access, claiming that ScriptJams has no right to examine the project.

* **Violation:** Non-Compliance with Audit.
* **Consequences:** Immediate suspension of License, presumption of breach, monetary penalties, and possible court-ordered injunction requiring disclosure.

**Example B.3.4 – Obstruction of Author Rights**
A developer incorporates ScriptJams Software into their tool but refuses ScriptJams’ request to remove outdated or harmful code fragments that ScriptJams deems necessary to withdraw. The Licensee deliberately ignores repeated communications.

* **Violation:** Obstruction of Author Rights.
* **Consequences:** Formal breach notice, forced termination of License, permanent prohibition against future use of ScriptJams Software, and possible damages for continued unauthorized use.

**Example B.3.5 – Bad-Faith Use**
A Licensee uses the Software in the creation of a competing framework whose explicit marketing claims include disparaging ScriptJams, while still secretly incorporating portions of ScriptJams code without attribution.

* **Violation:** Bad-Faith Use and Misrepresentation.
* **Consequences:** Immediate license termination, cease-and-desist, and damages claims for both copyright infringement and reputational harm.

### B.4 Remedies Available to ScriptJams

In the event of a violation, ScriptJams may pursue one or more of the following remedies, at its sole discretion and without limitation:

1. **Written Warning and Notice of Breach** – Formal communication advising the Licensee of their violation and providing a limited window to cure the breach.
2. **Corrective Action Requirement** – Mandating that the Licensee issue corrected attribution notices, update project documentation, or publish public acknowledgments of ScriptJams’ authorship.
3. **Suspension or Termination of License** – Revoking the Licensee’s right to use the Software in whole or in part.
4. **Cease-and-Desist Orders** – Formal legal demands requiring the Licensee to stop infringing activities immediately.
5. **Injunctive Relief** – Seeking court orders to prevent ongoing or imminent violations.
6. **Damages and Financial Compensation** – Seeking recovery of financial damages, including statutory damages under copyright law, compensatory damages, reputational damages, and recovery of legal fees.
7. **Permanent Blacklisting** – Recording the Licensee as a violator and permanently prohibiting the Licensee from future authorized use of ScriptJams Software.

---

### B.5 Case Studies of Enforcement

**Case Study B.5.1 – Cooperative Licensee**
A startup modifies ScriptJams Software but fails to attribute the changes. ScriptJams issues a notice of breach. The startup promptly issues a corrective attribution update in its README, adds notices to its website, and publicly apologizes.

* **Outcome:** License reinstated. No damages sought. Compliance restored.

**Case Study B.5.2 – Non-Cooperative Licensee**
An independent developer redistributes modified ScriptJams Software under a different name. ScriptJams issues multiple notices, but the developer refuses to comply. ScriptJams initiates legal proceedings and wins damages in court.

* **Outcome:** License permanently revoked. Court awards statutory damages and injunctive relief.

**Case Study B.5.3 – Bad-Faith Use Escalation**
A company deliberately incorporates ScriptJams Software into its competing product while attempting to conceal ScriptJams’ authorship. ScriptJams not only sues for damages but also issues a public statement exposing the violation.

* **Outcome:** Company suffers financial and reputational harm, loses customer trust, and is legally barred from future use.

---

### B.6 Preventive Measures for Licensees

To avoid violations, Licensees are strongly advised to adopt the following preventive practices:

1. Maintain a **compliance log** documenting all modifications to ScriptJams Software and how attribution has been applied.
2. Conduct **internal compliance audits** prior to distributing projects containing modified versions of the Software.
3. Designate a **compliance officer or developer lead** responsible for ensuring attribution requirements are fulfilled.
4. Respond **promptly and in good faith** to all communications from ScriptJams regarding potential violations.
5. Implement **version control practices** (e.g., Git commit history) that clearly indicate which portions of code originate from ScriptJams.

   * Decide whether the Software will be used “as-is” or whether modifications will be made.
   * Document this decision in a project compliance record.

3. **Assign a Compliance Officer**

   * For companies and organizations, designate an individual responsible for monitoring compliance.
   * For individual developers, create a personal checklist or version-control notes to ensure proper attribution if modifications occur.

4. **Establish Attribution Plan (If Modifications Are Anticipated)**

   * Determine where attribution will appear (README, About dialog, code comments, etc.).
   * Draft a model attribution statement for approval before release.

---

### C.4 During Development Checklist

While developing software that incorporates ScriptJams Software, Licensees should perform the following tasks on a regular basis:

1. **Track All Modifications**

   * Maintain a changelog or commit history in version control documenting every alteration to the ScriptJams code.
   * Tag modified files clearly to distinguish them from unmodified ScriptJams files.

2. **Embed Attribution Where Appropriate**

   * If code is modified, include attribution notices in headers, documentation, or user-facing materials.
   * Ensure attribution notices are updated if further changes are made.

3. **Internal Review**

   * Conduct regular peer reviews to confirm attribution compliance.
   * Verify that all developers are aware of their responsibilities under the License.

4. **Respect Author Rights**

   * Establish internal protocols to respond quickly if ScriptJams exercises its rights under Section 7 to request corrections or removals.

---

### C.5 Pre-Release Checklist

Before distributing any project that incorporates ScriptJams Software, Licensees must ensure the following:

1. **Confirm Attribution Compliance**

   * Double-check whether modifications were made.
   * If yes, confirm that attribution appears in all required locations.
   * If no, confirm that attribution is not misleadingly added (since it is only mandatory in modification cases).

2. **Review Documentation**

   * Ensure that project READMEs, user guides, or manuals include correct attribution language if required.
   * Confirm that end-users will reasonably be able to access and view the attribution.

3. **Legal Department Review (For Organizations)**

   * Submit final builds and documentation to legal counsel or a compliance officer for review.
   * Maintain a signed compliance certificate internally.

4. **Final Internal Audit**

   * Perform a last-stage audit to confirm all obligations are met.
   * Store audit logs as evidence of compliance in case of dispute.

---

### C.6 Post-Release Checklist

Even after a project is released, compliance obligations continue. Licensees should maintain the following practices:

1. **Ongoing Monitoring**

   * Ensure future updates to the project do not accidentally remove required attribution.
   * Document all further modifications to ScriptJams Software.

2. **Audit Preparedness**

   * Maintain a compliance file that includes changelogs, attribution statements, and audit records.
   * Be ready to present these if ScriptJams initiates an audit under Section 8.

3. **Responsive Communication**

   * Designate a team member to respond promptly to any inquiries from ScriptJams.
   * Treat all communications as priority-level compliance matters.

4. **End-of-Life or Removal**

   * If the ScriptJams Software is removed from a project, ensure that all residual references are also removed to avoid confusion.
   * Document the removal in compliance logs.

---

### C.7 Risk Warnings

Failure to comply with the License carries substantial risk. Common pitfalls include:

* Forgetting to add attribution after modifications.
* Mislabeling ScriptJams Software as entirely original work.
* Ignoring audit requests.
* Refusing ScriptJams’ correction/removal requests.

Licensees are reminded that violations may lead not only to termination of their License but also to legal liability, financial damages, reputational harm, and permanent prohibition from future use of ScriptJams Software.

# **Appendix D: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

*(Interpretive Guidance for the ScriptJams License)*

---

### D.1 Purpose of this Appendix

The following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) are intended to provide practical clarity to Licensees. While the License itself is legally binding, this FAQ serves as interpretive guidance to help developers and organizations understand how to apply the License in real-world contexts. In the event of conflict between this Appendix and the actual License text, the License text shall prevail.

The FAQs below have been organized into thematic sections:

1. **General Use**
2. **Redistribution and Branding**
3. **Attribution Requirements**
4. **Author Rights and Modifications**
5. **Audit and Compliance**
6. **Termination and Remedies**
7. **Practical Development Scenarios**

---

### D.2 General Use

**Q1: Can I use ScriptJams Software in my project for free?**
Yes. The ScriptJams License grants permission to use, modify, and integrate the Software without payment of fees or royalties. However, use is subject to the conditions outlined in the License, particularly concerning redistribution and attribution when modifications are made.

**Q2: Do I need to notify ScriptJams before using the Software?**
No prior notification is required. You may download, integrate, and use the Software independently. However, ScriptJams reserves the right to conduct audits and request compliance records (see Section 8).

**Q3: Can I use ScriptJams Software in a commercial product?**
Yes. Commercial use is permitted. The License places no restrictions on monetization or commercialization of projects incorporating the Software. The only limitations are on redistribution under a different name/brand and attribution when modifications are made.

---

### D.3 Redistribution and Branding

**Q4: Can I redistribute ScriptJams Software as part of my own package?**
You may redistribute the Software only if it is **clearly attributed to ScriptJams** when modifications have been made. You may not rebrand or present the Software as entirely your own creation.

**Q5: What if I make only very minor changes?**
If even minor modifications are made — such as adjusting functions, renaming variables, or changing comments — attribution is required. ScriptJams considers **any substantive alteration** sufficient to trigger attribution obligations.

**Q6: Can I rename the Software?**
No. Renaming ScriptJams Software for redistribution, even with modifications, is considered a violation under Section 5 (“Redistribution Restrictions”). While you may describe your project in any way you like, the portion of your project derived from ScriptJams must remain identifiable as such.

---

### D.4 Attribution Requirements

**Q7: Do I need to provide attribution if I use the Software without modifications?**
No. If the Software is used **as-is**, attribution is not strictly required. However, many Licensees voluntarily choose to provide credit as a courtesy, which ScriptJams encourages.

**Q8: Where should attribution appear if modifications are made?**
Attribution should appear in at least one of the following:

* Project README file
* “About” or “Credits” section of the application
* Documentation distributed with the project
* Source code file headers where modifications occur

**Q9: What does “clear and visible attribution” mean?**
Attribution must be readable and reasonably accessible to anyone who uses the Software or its derivatives. For example, burying a small notice deep in a code comment without mentioning it in the README would not be considered sufficient.

---

### D.5 Author Rights and Modifications

**Q10: What rights does ScriptJams retain over my project if I use their code?**
ScriptJams does not own your project. You retain ownership and control over your project as a whole. However, ScriptJams retains the right to request corrections, removals, or other compliance actions related to the portions of your project that incorporate ScriptJams Software (see Section 7).

**Q11: Can ScriptJams directly modify my project without my consent?**
No. ScriptJams cannot unilaterally alter your project. Instead, ScriptJams may issue requests requiring you to correct, update, or remove portions of the Software within your project. Compliance with these requests is mandatory under the License.

**Q12: What happens if I disagree with ScriptJams’ requested changes?**
If you believe a request is unreasonable, you may engage in good-faith discussion with ScriptJams. However, refusal to comply ultimately constitutes a breach of the License, which may result in termination of your rights to use the Software.

---

### D.6 Audit and Compliance

**Q13: How often can ScriptJams audit my project?**
Audits may occur at ScriptJams’ discretion but are generally expected to be reasonable and infrequent. The purpose of audits is to verify compliance, not to interfere with day-to-day development.

**Q14: What will an audit look like in practice?**
An audit request may involve:

* Requesting a copy of project documentation showing attribution placement
* Reviewing changelogs or version-control records of modifications
* Confirming that redistribution has not misrepresented ScriptJams’ authorship

**Q15: Do I have to give ScriptJams access to my private repositories?**
Not necessarily. If you can provide sufficient compliance evidence through documentation, changelogs, or limited access, full repository access may not be required. However, refusal to provide **any evidence** will constitute non-compliance.

---

### D.7 Termination and Remedies

**Q16: What happens if I breach the License?**
If you breach the License, ScriptJams may issue a notice of violation. Depending on the severity, ScriptJams may:

* Give you a chance to correct the issue, or
* Immediately terminate your License and pursue legal remedies.

**Q17: If my License is terminated, what happens to my existing projects?**
You must immediately remove ScriptJams Software (and all derivative code) from your projects. Continuing to use the Software after termination constitutes copyright infringement.

**Q18: Can ScriptJams sue me for damages?**
Yes. ScriptJams reserves the right to seek damages, including statutory damages under copyright law, compensatory damages for harm caused, and recovery of legal fees.

---

### D.8 Practical Development Scenarios

**Q19: I used ScriptJams Software in a school project. Do I need to do anything?**
If you did not modify the Software, no attribution is required. If you modified the Software, you must add attribution (e.g., in your project report or README). Educational use does not exempt you from compliance.

**Q20: I built a commercial product with ScriptJams Software and changed parts of it. Do I need to mention ScriptJams in my marketing?**
No. Attribution is only required in technical or project documentation, not in advertising or marketing materials. However, if your legal documentation includes acknowledgments, ScriptJams attribution should appear there.

**Q21: I want to merge ScriptJams Software with another open-source project. Is this allowed?**
Yes, but you must ensure compliance with both licenses. If modifications are made, ScriptJams must be attributed, and redistribution cannot rebrand the Software.

**Q22: What if I only use a very small portion of ScriptJams Software?**
If the portion is unmodified, attribution is not required. If it is modified, attribution is required, regardless of how small the portion is.

---

### D.9 Closing Notes

This FAQ is not exhaustive. If Licensees encounter situations not covered here, they are strongly encouraged to contact ScriptJams directly for clarification. Acting in good faith and seeking guidance is always preferable to assuming permissibility and risking violation.

---

### E.7 Inadequate Attribution Examples

To illustrate the difference, here are examples of **non-compliant attribution** and why they fail:

* **Non-Compliant Statement:**

  > “Based on open-source code.”

  * *Failure:* This is too vague and does not identify ScriptJams.

* **Non-Compliant Statement:**

  > “Original by \[Licensee].”

  * *Failure:* This falsely claims authorship of unmodified portions.

* **Non-Compliant Statement:**

  > “Code borrowed from various sources.”

  * *Failure:* This conceals ScriptJams’ contribution and fails to satisfy the License.

---

### E.8 Practical Checklist

When drafting attribution statements, Licensees should confirm that the statement:

1. **Mentions ScriptJams by name.**
2. **Acknowledges modifications** (if any were made).
3. **Identifies the Licensee** as responsible for those modifications.
4. **Appears in a visible, accessible location.**
5. **Does not mislead users** about authorship or ownership.

# **Appendix F: Compliance Guidelines for Organizations and Teams**

*(Best Practices for Corporate, Educational, and Institutional Licensees)*

---

### F.1 Purpose of this Appendix

While individual developers often work informally with the ScriptJams Software, organizations—such as companies, universities, research labs, non-profits, and government agencies—must operate under stricter compliance frameworks. These entities have multiple employees, departments, and stakeholders, any of whom may interact with or modify the ScriptJams Software.

This Appendix provides detailed **organizational compliance guidelines** to ensure that teams adhere to the ScriptJams License consistently across all levels. These guidelines address internal training, recordkeeping, departmental responsibilities, and governance mechanisms.

---

### F.2 The Importance of Organizational Compliance

For organizations, compliance with the ScriptJams License is not merely a legal formality but a **strategic necessity**. Non-compliance may result in:

1. **Legal Liability:** Breach of the License may expose the organization to lawsuits, damages, or injunctions.
2. **Financial Loss:** Violations may require costly re-engineering of products, customer recalls, or loss of investment.
3. **Reputational Damage:** Public disclosure of non-compliance could harm trust with customers, partners, and investors.
4. **Operational Disruption:** ScriptJams retains rights to request correction or removal of their Software from non-compliant projects, which may interrupt business operations.

Thus, compliance safeguards both the **legal integrity** and the **operational stability** of the organization.

---

### F.3 Organizational Roles and Responsibilities

Organizations should clearly define roles to ensure accountability for License compliance:

1. **Executive Leadership (Board, C-Suite, or Project Sponsors)**

   * Approve adoption of ScriptJams Software.
   * Allocate resources for compliance activities.
   * Hold ultimate responsibility for legal and reputational outcomes.

2. **Compliance Officer (or Equivalent Role)**

   * Oversees interpretation and enforcement of the License within the organization.
   * Maintains compliance documentation and coordinates audits.
   * Serves as the primary contact with ScriptJams in case of disputes or inquiries.

3. **Project Managers**

   * Ensure project-specific adherence to the License.
   * Incorporate compliance requirements into project timelines and deliverables.
   * Review attribution requirements when modifications are made.

4. **Developers and Engineers**

   * Follow coding standards that reflect attribution obligations.
   * Maintain clear changelogs of modifications to ScriptJams Software.
   * Immediately report any potential compliance issues to managers.

5. **Legal Department**

   * Interpret ambiguous provisions of the License.
   * Review release notes, documentation, and contracts for compliance.
   * Advise executives on risk management strategies.

6. **Quality Assurance (QA) Teams**

   * Test not only functionality but also compliance (e.g., attribution visibility in software).
   * Verify that build pipelines do not strip required notices.

---

### F.4 Compliance Training and Awareness

Organizations must ensure that **all relevant staff** understand their obligations under the ScriptJams License. Recommended steps include:

1. **Onboarding Training:**
   Every new developer should receive training on the ScriptJams License, particularly the distinction between unmodified use (no attribution required) and modified use (attribution required).

2. **Annual Refresher Courses:**
   Conduct mandatory refresher sessions to reinforce compliance obligations and update employees on any changes to the License.

3. **Departmental Workshops:**
   Project managers, QA testers, and legal staff should attend role-specific sessions that explain their unique responsibilities.

4. **Compliance Handbooks:**
   Distribute internal manuals summarizing the ScriptJams License in simplified terms, with flowcharts and checklists.

5. **Certification Programs:**
   Larger organizations may require developers to pass internal compliance assessments before committing code to repositories that include ScriptJams Software.

---

### F.5 Organizational Workflows for Compliance

To operationalize compliance, organizations should integrate the following workflows into their development lifecycle:

1. **Pre-Adoption Review:**

   * Legal and compliance officers review the License before incorporating ScriptJams Software.
   * A risk assessment is conducted to determine suitability.

2. **Version Control Protocols:**

   * All modifications to ScriptJams Software must be tracked in Git or equivalent systems.
   * Commit messages must explicitly reference when a change affects ScriptJams code.

3. **Attribution Approval Workflow:**

   * Draft attribution statements (see Appendix E).
   * Route drafts through compliance officers for approval.
   * Store approved templates in a shared repository for reuse.

4. **Release Management:**

   * QA verifies attribution requirements are included in release candidates.
   * Legal performs a compliance review before any distribution.

5. **Post-Release Monitoring:**

   * Compliance teams maintain logs of all ScriptJams Software included in released products.
   * Any updates or patches must re-check attribution requirements.

---

### F.6 Internal Compliance Audits

Organizations are strongly encouraged to conduct **internal compliance audits** at regular intervals. Recommended practices include:

1. **Frequency:** At least semi-annually, or more frequently for high-risk projects.
2. **Scope:** Audits should review all codebases, documentation, and release notes for compliance.
3. **Audit Team Composition:** Compliance officer, legal counsel, developer representatives, and QA leads.
4. **Audit Deliverables:** A written report identifying compliance strengths, weaknesses, and required corrections.
5. **Corrective Action Plans:** Audits must include deadlines for addressing deficiencies.

---

### F.7 Communication Protocols with ScriptJams

# **Appendix G: Enforcement, Remedies, and Case Studies**

*(Understanding the Consequences of Non-Compliance with the ScriptJams License)*

---

### G.1 Purpose of this Appendix

The purpose of this Appendix is to provide Licensees with a clear understanding of how violations of the ScriptJams License are detected, addressed, and resolved. While the License itself contains binding legal obligations, this Appendix is intended to **contextualize enforcement mechanisms, clarify remedies available to ScriptJams, and provide practical insights** into how disputes may unfold.

Through detailed analysis, this Appendix ensures that Licensees—whether individuals or organizations—are equipped to anticipate enforcement actions, understand the range of possible remedies, and proactively mitigate risks before violations escalate into formal disputes.

---

### G.2 Enforcement Philosophy of ScriptJams

ScriptJams adopts a **measured and proportional enforcement philosophy** rooted in the following principles:

1. **Good Faith First:** ScriptJams seeks voluntary compliance before pursuing legal remedies. Initial enforcement will generally take the form of notices, requests, or opportunities to cure violations.
2. **Proportional Response:** Minor, unintentional violations (e.g., missing attribution in one location) may be addressed differently than egregious or willful violations (e.g., redistributing ScriptJams code as proprietary software under another brand).
3. **Preservation of Relationships:** ScriptJams recognizes that many Licensees are collaborators, contributors, or customers. Enforcement actions are designed to correct behavior without unnecessarily severing relationships.
4. **Defense of Integrity:** Despite a collaborative philosophy, ScriptJams will act decisively to defend the integrity of its Software, its reputation, and its legal rights.

---

### G.3 Types of Violations

Violations of the ScriptJams License generally fall into several categories:

1. **Attribution Failures:**

   * Modifications are made without acknowledging ScriptJams.
   * Attribution is misleading, incomplete, or hidden.

2. **Unauthorized Redistribution:**

   * Re-releasing the Software under another name, brand, or organization.
   * Selling or sublicensing ScriptJams code without authorization.

3. **Obstruction of Author Rights:**

   * Ignoring or refusing to respond to ScriptJams’ requests under Section 7.
   * Intentionally concealing use of the Software to avoid detection.

4. **Misrepresentation and Fraud:**

   * Claiming authorship of ScriptJams’ original code.
   * Providing false statements in documentation or public releases.

5. **Derivative Abuse:**

   * Using the Software in a modified state without attribution.
   * Removing licensing notices and replacing them with contradictory terms.

---

### G.4 Enforcement Process

Enforcement generally follows a multi-step process:

1. **Detection:**
   Violations are identified through community reports, audits, routine monitoring, or internal review by ScriptJams.

2. **Initial Contact:**
   ScriptJams will typically issue a **Notice of Non-Compliance** outlining the nature of the violation, required corrective action, and a deadline for response.

3. **Opportunity to Cure:**
   Licensees are usually provided a **reasonable timeframe** (e.g., 15–30 days) to correct the violation without penalty.

4. **Escalation:**
   If the Licensee fails to cure the violation, ScriptJams may:

   * Issue a **Cease and Desist Order**.
   * Terminate the License.
   * Demand removal of ScriptJams code from the Licensee’s project.

5. **Legal Remedies:**
   In cases of persistent or egregious violations, ScriptJams may seek judicial relief, including damages, injunctions, and attorney’s fees.

---

### G.5 Remedies Available to ScriptJams

ScriptJams reserves the following remedies:

1. **Corrective Action:**
   Requirement that the Licensee immediately cure the violation (e.g., add missing attribution).

2. **Public Clarification:**
   ScriptJams may issue public statements clarifying its authorship when Licensees misrepresent authorship.

3. **License Termination:**
   Upon termination, the Licensee loses all rights to use, modify, or distribute ScriptJams Software.

4. **Code Removal:**
   ScriptJams may demand the removal of its Software from Licensee projects.

5. **Injunctive Relief:**
   Courts may issue injunctions prohibiting further distribution of non-compliant software.

6. **Monetary Damages:**
   ScriptJams may seek compensatory damages for financial harm caused by the violation, including lost profits.

7. **Attorney’s Fees and Costs:**
   In litigation, courts may require the Licensee to reimburse ScriptJams for legal expenses.

### G.6 Case Studies

To illustrate the enforcement process, the following case studies demonstrate how different types of violations may unfold in practice.

---

#### **Case Study 1 – Missing Attribution in a Modified Library**

**Scenario:**
An open-source developer modifies ScriptJams code and releases it on GitHub but forgets to include attribution in the documentation.

**Detection:**
A community contributor reports the repository to ScriptJams.

**Enforcement:**
ScriptJams issues a **Notice of Non-Compliance**, requesting that attribution be added within 15 days.

**Remedy:**
The developer updates the README and code headers to include proper attribution.

**Outcome:**
The issue is resolved informally, and no further enforcement is pursued.

---

#### **Case Study 2 – Corporate Redistribution Under a New Brand**

**Scenario:**

### G.7 Escalation Ladder for Enforcement

To help Licensees understand enforcement escalation, the following ladder is provided:

1. **Informal communication** (email, request).
2. **Notice of Non-Compliance.**
3. **Opportunity to Cure (15–30 days).**
4. **Cease and Desist Order.**
5. **License Termination.**
6. **Legal action in court.**

Licensees who respond early and cooperatively will rarely see escalation beyond step 2.

---

### G.8 Mitigating Factors

When determining remedies, ScriptJams may consider:

* **Good Faith Efforts:** Did the Licensee attempt compliance?
* **Scope of Violation:** Was the breach minor or widespread?
* **Intent:** Was the violation accidental, negligent, or deliberate?
* **Impact:** Did the violation cause measurable harm to ScriptJams?
* **Cooperation:** Did the Licensee cooperate in resolving the issue?

### G.9 Preventative Measures for Licensees

To avoid enforcement altogether, Licensees are encouraged to:

1. Conduct regular self-audits.
2. Use checklists for attribution (Appendix E).
3. Maintain transparent communication with ScriptJams.
4. Establish compliance workflows (Appendix F).
5. Adopt a culture of integrity in software development.

---

### G.10 Closing Note

Enforcement is not designed to punish Licensees but to ensure the **integrity, fairness, and continuity** of ScriptJams Software. By understanding the enforcement process and remedies, Licensees can take proactive measures to remain compliant and avoid unnecessary disputes.
